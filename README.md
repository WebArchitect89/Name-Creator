## Description

In this challenge I created a server app which generates a random name. 

I achieved that by creating a GET and POST server request where I would render the index.ejs file. 
I would also use EJS templates, practice EJS tags, pass data to EJS templates and use EJS partials and layouts. 

As a user you would want to create a random name from a noun and an adjective.

Yhe app ir running on localhost:3000.
